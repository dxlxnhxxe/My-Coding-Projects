Hello,

This folder contains code for game projects. 
I followed FreeCodeCamp.org's Youtube video "Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games - Full Course" with Ania Kubrow as the instructor. 
For some of these projects I have added or modified some code to tailor the game a bit more to my liking.
When I am done with the 7 projects and I have finished the customisations I will indicate that here.
